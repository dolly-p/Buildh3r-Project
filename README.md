# I participated in the buildh3r workshops and found each of them to be fun.
As a cryptography and blockchain enthusiast, I am definitely going to devote more time to learning how to use the technologies taught.
I did the tasks for Metis and ZKM. I attempted Aleo but only on the playground. I couldn't download my project to my local device to be pushed to Github.
# I would like to extend my gratitude to BuildH3R, ZKM, Metis, and Aleo for organizing this.
